# Description
The Mask Classification project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: with a mask and without a mask. 
The model was developed to provide an automated solution for monitoring mask compliance, crucial in scenarios such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This project highlights the effectiveness of deep learning models in binary image classification tasks.
