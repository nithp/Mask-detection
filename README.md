# Description
The Mask Classification project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: with a mask and without a mask. 
The model was developed to provide an automated solution for monitoring mask compliance, crucial in scenarios such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This project highlights the effectiveness of deep learning models in binary image classification tasks.

# Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers: The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, designed to extract features from the input images.
Pooling Layers: Pooling layers are used after the convolutional layers to downsample the feature maps and reduce computational load.
Fully Connected Layers: Following the feature extraction, fully connected layers map the features to the binary classification output.
Output Layer: The final layer is a sigmoid layer that outputs probabilities for each class (mask or no mask).
